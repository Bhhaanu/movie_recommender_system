# movie_recommender_system

We got our dataset from Kaggle platform, instead of dowloading it intoour system we directly uploaded the code to colab cloud using api token.

So for executing our code we can either directly donwload the dataset from kaggle platform and upload the dataset to google could using files
module or can download the api token from kaggle account, then copy the api command for that specific data.

we uploaded kaggle.json to colab for authorizing the dataset uasge from kaggle and copies the specific api command for that dataset.
(kaggle datasets download -d tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

Rest of the execution of cells is plain and just needs shift+enter to 
execute.
